The `DashboardService` class provides helper functions for administrative dashboard operations, including access restrictions and paginated user management. It ensures that the logged-in admin user cannot edit or view their own profile via the dashboard and supports user list pagination.

**Setup**
```php
use Core\Services\DashboardService;
```

‚úÖ **Common Use Cases**
- Prevent the logged-in admin from editing or viewing their own profile via the dashboard.
- Retrieve a paginated list of all users excluding the current admin.
- Get a count of users for dashboard summaries and stats.

`checkIfCurrentUser(Users $user, string $redirect = ''): void`

DashboardService::checkIfCurrentUser($user, 'admindashboard.users');
```

<br>

`paginateUsers(Pagination $pagination): array`

Returns an array of paginated users, excluding the currently logged-in admin. Sorting is done in descending order by `created_at`.

`totalUserCountExceptCurrent(): int`

Returns the total number of users in the system, excluding the currently logged-in admin. This can be used for admin dashboard statistics or analytics.

- All queries exclude the current logged-in user to prevent unintentional self-editing or display within administrative lists.
- The pagination relies on the `Pagination` class to generate SQL query parameters for the `Users` model.
- This service is intentionally minimal and can be extended with additional dashboard-specific helper methods such as widget registration, statistics blocks, or activity feeds.
