In Chappy.php, services are dedicated classes that encapsulate reusable, domain-specific logic to keep controllers and models clean and focused. They follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and are ideal for handling complex workflows, cross-cutting concerns, or business logic that doesn‚Äôt belong in a model or controller.
üõ† Purpose

Services act as the bridge between your application‚Äôs components ‚Äî controllers call services to perform tasks, and services interact with models or libraries as needed. This pattern improves testability, readability, and long-term maintainability.
üß≠ When to Use Services

Use a service class when:
- Logic spans multiple models or system components
- Code is repeated across multiple controllers
- Logic doesn‚Äôt belong in a controller (which should orchestrate) or model (which should persist data)
- You want to keep code modular and testable

üìÅ Location
Builtin service classes reside in:
```bash
/src/core/Services
```

Each service class is namespaced as:
```php
namespace Core\Services;
```
You may group services by domain if your application scales (e.g., AuthService, UserService, MailService).

üìå Available Services
- ACLService: Manages tasks related to access control levels.
- AuthService: Manages login, logout, and session handling.
- AttachmentService: Processes email attachments and handles preview or deletion.
- DashboardService: Coordinates admin dashboard actions like pagination or access checks.
- UserService: Handles profile updates, password changes, image uploads, and account status logic.

## 2. User Defined Services <a id="service-services"></a><span style="float: right; font-size: 14px; padding-top: 15px;">[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)</span>
You can create your own service with the following command:
```sh
php console make:service ${service_name}
```

All user defined services are namespaced as:
```php
namespace App\Services;
```

When you create a new service the command attempts to identify the correct name of the model that the service supports.  Here is an example:
```php
<?php
namespace App\Services;

use App\Models\Product;

/**
 * Service that supports the Product model.
 */
class ProductService {

}
```
